Unlike the commonly cited hierarchical edge bundling (Zhou et al 2013), the data in this project is real positional data rather than abstracted start point to end point data.

The per-plane segment grouping might be improved if I modified the algorithm to use great arc distances instead of Euclidean, which I used because that was what the paper used.



========

Lit Review
- Compare existing visualizations or methods, mention usage or discarding.

Design
